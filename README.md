Fun project to discover the Angular CDK Drag and Drop ...

# Contribution
Everyone is invited to fork and contribute to this :)

## Ideas to do...
- Backend to manage global tool structure data and personal snippets
- Importing tool structure data through API's of the tool... if there is something
- Convertion to a PWA running in Electron to run the built commands directly
- Flashcard learning game "command <--> description"
- Highlight drop area(s) while dragging 
- Code refactoring
- Visual Design...
